The WordPress Book Review plugin saves you time when writing your book review posts – no more copying and pasting or manually entering in a book’s details. Instead, you can focus on the important stuff, like actually writing your reviews!

The plugin can also help to increase traffic to your site by creating better-looking search results in Google that will make yours stand out from the rest.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Synopsis field for? =

The *Synopsis* field is meant to hold the summary or description of the book. It is not where you are intended to write your review. You should write your review in the regular WordPress editor at the top of the page, although if you prefer you can certainly write it inside the *Synopsis* editor instead. Be aware that if you do that, the custom links will show at the very bottom of your post, rather than directly below the book's description and cover image.

= Why is my title sorting on "A", "An" or "The" in the title archives? =

Titles that start with "A", "An" or "The" are sorted using the second word in the title. For example, *The Hunger Games* would be shown as *Hunger Games, The*. If you have a post that is not sorting this way, try going back into that post and re-saving it.

= Why is my post not showing up in the genre archives? =

Check to ensure that you have filled out the *Genre* field in the *Book Info* section of the post, and that the *Include post in archives* checkbox is selected.

= Why do the archives take a long time to load? =

If you are showing thumbnails of the book covers in your archives, then you should be aware that thumbnails are only used in those themes that support Featured Images. If your theme does not support Featured Images, or if a post does not have a Featured Image set, then scaled-down versions of the full-size covers are used. The images are scaled down as per the *Thumbnail size* value in the *Media Settings*. Showing thumbnails in the archive(s) without using Featured Images will result in longer page load times.

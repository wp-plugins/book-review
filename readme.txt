The WordPress Book Review Plugin adds a *Book Info* section to the *Add New Post* and *Edit Post* pages. Fill this out whenever you would like to show more information about a particular book. Note that, at a minimum, *Title* must be specified in order for the information to show at the top of the post, and any fields that you leave blank will not appear. These fields include:

* Title (required)
* Series
* Author
* Genre
* Publisher
* Release Date
* Format
* Pages
* Source
* Up to five customized URLS (as configured in the settings)
* Cover URL
* Summary

If the *Book Info* section has been filled out, these details will appear above the post's content.

= Features =
* Customizable background and border colours.
* Ability to optionally show ratings on the home page.

= About Me =
As a book blogger myself, I have my finger on the pulse of the book blogging community, and so I have a very good sense of what it is that other book bloggers are looking for in a WordPress plugin. I use the Book Review plugin on my own [Book Wookie](http://bookwookie.ca) blog. Please visit if you'd like to see examples of this plugin in action. Feel free to email me at thebookwookie@gmail.com with the address of your own blog as well. I would love to find new blogs to follow and to see my plugin being used elsewhere!

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and extract it.
1. Upload the `book-review` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your server.
1. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
1. Customize the settings by clicking on *Book Review* in the *Settings* menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is the Book Review plugin for? =

The Book Review plugin is meant to be used by book bloggers and other reviewers who post book reviews to their blog and need an easy way to show the details of that book in each of their review posts.

= What is the Summary field for? =

The Summary field is meant to hold the synopsis or description of the book. It is not where you are intended to write your review. You should write your review in the regular WordPress editor at the top of the page, although if you prefer you can certainly write it inside the Summary editor instead. Be aware that if you do that, the custom links will show at the very bottom of your post, rather than directly below the book's description and cover image.

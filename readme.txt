Add details such as title, author, cover photo, rating, purchase links and more to each of your book review posts. Show archives by title or genre.

== Description ==

The WordPress Book Review Plugin adds a *Book Info* section to regular posts and custom post types. Fill this out whenever you would like to show more information about a particular book. Note that, at a minimum, *Title* must be specified in order for the information to show at the top of the post, and any fields that you leave blank will not appear. These fields include:

* ISBN (Only visible if a Google API Key has been entered on the *Book Review Settings* page.)
* Title (required)
* Series
* Author
* Genre
* Publisher
* Release Date
* Format
* Pages
* Source
* Customized URLS (as defined by the settings)
* Cover URL
* Synopsis
* Rating
* Include post in archives

If the *Book Info* section has been filled out, these details (with the exception of ISBN) will appear in the post.

= Features =
* Retrieve details about a book automatically from Google Books.
* Show details like rating, author and published date in search engine results pages.
* Position the review box either above or below the post's content.
* Customizable background and border colours.
* Ability to optionally show ratings on the home page when summary text is used.
* Use the built-in star rating images or specify your own.
* Configure text or image-based custom links.
* Open your custom links in the same tab or in a new one.
* Show an archive of your reviews by title or genre.

= Internationalization =
This plugin supports the following translations: Arabic, Chinese, Czech, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `book-review` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your server.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Synopsis field for? =

The *Synopsis* field is meant to hold the summary or description of the book. It is not where you are intended to write your review. You should write your review in the regular WordPress editor at the top of the page, although if you prefer you can certainly write it inside the *Synopsis* editor instead. Be aware that if you do that, the custom links will show at the very bottom of your post, rather than directly below the book's description and cover image.

= Why is my title sorting on "A", "An" or "The" in the title archives? =

Titles that start with "A", "An" or "The" should be sorted using the second word in the title. For example, *The Hunger Games* would be shown as *Hunger Games, The*. If you have a post that is not sorting this way, try going back into that post and re-saving it.

= Why is my post not showing up in the genre archives? =

Check to ensure that you have filled out the *Genre* field in the *Book Info* section of the post, and that the *Include post in archives* checkbox is selected.

= Why do the archives take a long time to load? =

If you are showing thumbnails of the book covers in your archives, then you should be aware that thumbnails are only used in those themes that support Featured Images. If your theme does not support Featured Images, or if a post does not have a Featured Image set, then scaled-down versions of the full-size covers are used. The images are scaled down as per the *Thumbnail size* value in the *Media Settings*. Showing thumbnails in the archive(s) without using Featured Images will result in longer page load times. To aid in determining which images are thumbnails and which are scaled-down versions of the original image, you can click on any cover to see it shown at its true size. If the image is small, then you know a thumbnail is being used. Otherwise, you should go back into that particular post and set the Featured Image.
